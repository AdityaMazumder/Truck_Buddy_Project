# Truck_Buddy_Project

Predictive maintenance has gained significant attention in recent years. Our solution is a website that will serve as a maintenance reminder, servicing journal, nearest servicing station finder, and a comprehensive solution for all things related to the servicing and maintenance of heavy transport vehicles.

Development Strategy

The website  leverages a machine learning model specifically designed for predictive maintenance. The project  involves maintenance engineers, data scientists, and domain experts to gather detailed requirements. Historical maintenance data, sensor readings, and equipment logs is collected. The data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise, handle missing values, and ensure consistency. An intuitive UI for maintenance engineers and operators displays real-time equipment health status, predictions, and recommended actions. Visualizations such as charts and graphs are included for better understanding. The website implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user privacy.

Implementation Strategy

The trained machine learning model is deployed as APIs to ensure scalability and responsiveness for real-time predictions. User Experience: Transporters, engineers, and operators will benefit from an intuitive user interface designed for efficiency. The website  includes a model for monitoring performance and data drift, with alerts set up for critical events (e.g., sudden degradation). The platform and machine learning model is regularly updated based on new data to accurately monitor performance and promptly address any issues.

Strategy for Commercialization

Maintenance Managers, Operations Managers, Plant Managers, and C-suite executives of transportation, manufacturing, and utilities companies. Emphasize the growing need for cost reduction, increased equipment uptime, and improved safety, highlighting how predictive maintenance addresses these needs. Monthly or annual subscriptions with tiered pricing based on features and number of users. Basic features are going free, with premium features available at a cost. Custom pricing will be offered for large organizations.

Expected Environmental Impact

Our predictive maintenance platform aims to have a positive and significant impact on the environment and sustainability efforts: By implementing data-driven strategies, organizations can optimize equipment health, minimizing unnecessary maintenance and reducing waste from over-maintenance or premature replacements. Utilizing historical data and IoT sensor data, maintenance cycles can be extended without negatively impacting machinery performance, resulting in lower energy usage and reduced environmental impact.
In summary, predictive maintenance not only improves operational efficiency but also aligns with environmental sustainability goals.
